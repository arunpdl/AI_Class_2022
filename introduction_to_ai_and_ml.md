# Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. The field of artificial intelligence, or AI, is concerned with not just understanding but also building intelligent entitiesâ€”machines that can compute how to act effectively and safely in a wide variety of novel situations.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that studies the ability to improve performance based on experience. Some AI systems use machine learning methods to achieve competence, but some do not.
